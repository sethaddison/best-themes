## Do you have any suggestions?

First, this theme is new so if something is off the grid, please open an issue. Because, there are many languages and parts of VS Code I don't know about, so let me know if anything goes wrong.

If you would like to change something personally, you can either open a PR and see if I'd like it added, or override the colours in your own settings.json file.

Start upon that here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference


Also file issues [here](https://github.com/lakshits11/best-themes/issues), if you like.

**Note: This pack is still in development so somethings may be off the grid. Report them immediately.**
